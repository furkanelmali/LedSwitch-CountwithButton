# LedSwitch-CountwithButton
 In this application using STM32F100RB, the LEDs flash sequentially every time we press the button until a limit is reached. The problem that needed to be solved in the application was the debouncing caused by the button. I was able to prevent this by adding a small control variable to the code.
